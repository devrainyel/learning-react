We'll move the tracking page to react (open the website, go to the orders page, adn click a "Track package" button.
-Move  over the HTML (remember to reuse the <Header> component).
-Download supersimple.dev/images/tracking-favicon.png and use it as the favicon.
-Move over the CSS, rename it to match the Component, and import. 
-Create a route for the tracking page in App.js (use path="tracking")
-Open the website and test out the tracking page
