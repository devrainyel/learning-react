Rename the header.css to Header.css so it matches the component's name. Check the git section to see if git detected the change.
-If git detected the change, save the change into git (using Commit).
-If git did not detect the change, this happens because on some operating systems (Windows and Mac), git is case-insensitive. That means header.css and Header.css are considered the same.
-To fix this, rename header.css to something like header2.css. Save these changes into git (using Commit). Then, rename header2.css to Header.css and git will now detect the change.
