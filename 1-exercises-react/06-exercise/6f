React Router has another component called <NavLink> that is useful for navigation links (links at the top of a page, usually in a header).
-For an example, check apple.com and see the links at the top.
-In Header.jsx, update all <Link> to <NavLink>s (props are the same).
-The special feature of <NavLink> is it knows which page is loaded. For example, if you're on the Orders page, it adds a class called active to the Orders link (className="orders-link: ... active:").
-Inside Header.css, style the orders link so when it's active, "Orders" is underlined (Hint: .orders-link.active will style an element with the class orders-link and active. Use text-decoration: underline;)
-Open the website, go to the orders page, and check the Orders link in the header.
